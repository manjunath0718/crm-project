# CanovaCRM - MERN Stack CRM System

## Overview
CanovaCRM is a full-featured Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). It provides a modern, responsive interface for both administrators and employees to manage leads, employees, and sales activities efficiently.

## Features

- **Employee Management**: Add, edit, delete, and view employees. Fairly distribute leads when an employee is deleted.
- **Lead Management**: Upload leads via CSV, assign leads based on language/location, and track lead status.
- **Fair Lead Distribution**: When an employee is deleted, their unclosed leads are automatically and fairly distributed among remaining employees.
- **Authentication**: Separate login for admin and employees, with protected routes and auto-logout for inactivity.
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly UI for both admin and employee interfaces.
- **Activity Logging**: Track assignments and deal closures.

## Key Business Logic

### Fair Lead Distribution (When Deleting an Employee)
- **Unclosed Leads**: Calculated as `assignedLeads - closedLeads` for the deleted employee.
- **Distribution Rules**:
  1. If unclosed leads = number of remaining employees, assign one to each.
  2. If unclosed leads < number of employees, assign to those with the fewest leads.
  3. If unclosed leads > number of employees, distribute in round-robin starting with least loaded employees.
- **Result**: Ensures balanced workload and fairness.

### CSV Upload & Lead Assignment
- Upload leads with fields: Name, Email, Phone, Language, Location, etc.
- Leads are assigned to employees based on language/location match and current workload.
- Unassigned leads are distributed fairly using the same logic as above.

- For any issues, check the console logs in both client and server.
